Mobilize
------------

Overview
==========

* Mobilize is a fun centralized way to access your data lying inside multiple different technoligies under one roof understood by everyone - that is Excel sheets!!
* Mobilize can enable transfer of data across  diverse databases/technologies like to & from hive, hdfs, hbase, various apis, different databases so that people who are already well versed with dealing with excel sheets can still interact with these diverse technologies and be productive.
* The spreadsheets are currently hosted in the cloud on Google Spreadsheets, so that you can access them anywhere - even on your tablets.
* Mobilize in pluggable and extensible, so tomorrow if you want to access data from a cool new database techonology, you can just add a module for that.
